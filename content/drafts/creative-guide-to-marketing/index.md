In this post, I am going to share all the knowledge I have on becoming an excellent marketing professional. This guide is targeted towards beginners who want to build their career in the marketing field, especially if you are looking to join a startup. This can also be used by entrepreneurs building their own startups from scratch.

In this guide, I will try to help you develop the thinking necessary to become a good marketer, rather than focusing on the actual skills and know-how needed to do so, the later of course being something you can only develop through actual practice. We are going to approach this guide by thinking of marketing from first principles, by applying the Socratic Method - i.e. asking questions from the root of the domain.

Let's start with a simple question, what is Marketing? According to Wikipedia, "Marketing is the business process of creating relationships with and satisfying customers." But what does that even mean? A simpler definition would be a comment I once read from a random Internet stranger, "Marketing is about reaching as many people as possible, while Sales is about selling the brand or product to as many people as possible." So, essentially, you can think of marketing as any sort of effort you put into reaching as many (relevant) people as possible, for a given brand or product.

To understand marketing at a deeper level, one would also need to understand branding and sales. You will need to understand what is a brand and how a brand is built from scratch, and also what is Sales. You cannot be a good marketer without having a fundamental understanding of these two.

Another comment that I once heard from a friend of mine, while in conversation about advertisements on public transports was, "Marketing isn't always about reaching your target customer, it is often about creating your target customer. In other words, you don't always have to meet the demand or find a "product-market fit". There might not be any demand for the brand or product in the first place. But you can apply certain strategies to create demand for a brand or product out of thin air." I think this is a excellent observation, and something we will expand on later in the guide.
Through out this guide, we are going to use examples of brands and products and campaigns that executed excellent marketing strategies. We are going to focus on Clothing, Tech, Internet, and Food brands. You will be given case studies and perhaps even assignments as well, so that you can truly learn.

> "A good marketing campaign is when the end user or customer doesn't feel like you are trying to sell them something, i.e. when it doesn't feel like a marketing campaign itself"

A lot of Sales and Marketing, when you look under the hood, is really about psychology. Your job as a professional Marketer or Salesman is to understand the psychology of the people you (the company) are trying to sell to i.e. your target customers. The better you understand them, the better campaigns you can design and the better you can persuade them to buy a product.

Expert marketers have their own preferred method of developing this understanding of the people. When trying to approach it systematically, as a science, you do extensive and recurring market research, to gain more and more certainty about how the target customer thinks or feels about the idea or product. Other experts simply use their creative instinct or intuition, which they develop either through years of experience in the industry or by natural talent (which I believe is also something any person can develop, if they follow a certain lifestyle.)
The goal of any marketing campaign is to trigger a certain emotion in the audience, an emotion that can make them feel connected to the brand or product. Ideally, you would want the audience to like or fall in love with the brand or product. But sometimes, as we will talk about later, negative publicity can also be very helpful for a brand, because it keeps people talking about you.

### Building a Brand

Think of a brand as a person. Imagine for a moment that you are an author or filmmaker, and you are creating a fictional character out of thin air. People are going to watch and interact with this character in the real world. What does this character believe? What are their views and principles? What are their goals, what do they want to achieve?
Building a brand is such a process of creating a fictional character out of thin air. When you start thinking of building brands in this manner, everything else starts to come more naturally to you. If you keep the concept of buying and selling aside for a moment, you will start to notice that building a customer-base is really about building friendships with certain people among the general public. You want to build strong, loyal relationships with these people.
How do you build a friendship? Through common interests of course! People like saying that they "connect with their friends", that they share a vibe together. Building a relationship with a customer is the same, they connect with the brand. Or let me put it this way, a potential customer is more likely to use your products if they feel connected to them at some level, rather than not feeling anything at all.

How do you create such a connection? This is where brand building comes in. Brand Building includes everything from the logo of the company, to it's tagline, color theme, messaging etc. What do you as a brand put emphasis on? Are you proud of the quality of your product? Or how cheap it is?

### Negative Publicity

With the popularity of the Internet and Media, where everyone now demands a constant stream of non-stop stimulation and instantaneous gratification, individuals that are trying to build their own brands and following are more and more willing to use Negative Publicity to always stay in the news, to get people to keep talking about you. As long as people are talking about you, your career is alive and good. Yes, you would be a controversial figure, but you would still be making money or possibly even reach your desired goal.
Take a look at Internet personalities like Jake Paul, or even the way the Donald Trump campaign was run. They say and do things that unquestionable cross the line to seek attention, and they receive it, because people talk about what they have said or done. This keeps them in the news, and on the trajectory to reach their goals.
