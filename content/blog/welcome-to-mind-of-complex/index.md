Hello friend, I am Kapil, but on here I will refer to myself as Complex, my self-designated moniker. I like to describe myself as a curious wanderer, because I love to learn and ask questions about anything and everything. My superpower is my abundance of curiosity, an endless supply of desire to explore and learn just about everything. I think of myself as a seeker of truth. Almost everyday, I find myself questioning "is this it? or is there more to it?" no matter what I am doing or trying to figure out. It's almost as if curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism is programmed deep into my brain. 

I have always wanted to start a blog where I can share with the world all my thoughts, learnings, projects, views, ideas, life updates and general perspective, but never really got around to it. With this blog, I want to share with you the world inside my mind - the Mind of Complex.

I like to call myself Complex because whenever I look within me, inside my mind, that is exactly how I feel. My mind feels like a dense jungle of thoughts, ideas, opinions and perspectives about the world and everything in it. Most of it feels unstructured, some of it is hands down weird and strange. Itâ€™s mostly the product of my ADHD, but never the less, it makes life and the world very interesting sometimes. And at other times, absolutely chaotic. 

I am on the voyage of trying to learn and understand as much as I can about this world and fuse all my knowledge together from across domains to build novel things and solve hard problems, in the process hopefully making this world a slightly better place to live for everyone else. And I want to share my journey with you, through this blog.

Welcome to my mind, the Mind of Complex.
